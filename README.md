This is my SoftUniExercises repository.
Here you can find my solutions for each exercise from SoftUni Judge for the following courses: Programming Basics, Programming Fundamentals, C# Advanced(Advanced & OOP) and C# DataBase(MS SQL & Entity Framework).
I believe I would be helpful for your task problems!
Also I will appreciate it if you click on the star :)
